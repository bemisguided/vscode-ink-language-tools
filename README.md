## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Create a new file with the `.ink` extension
3. Start writing your interactive story!
4. The extension will automatically compile your story and show any errors in the Problems panel

## Example Usage

```ink
=== start ===
You wake up in a mysterious room.

* [Look around] -> examine_room
* [Try the door] -> try_door
+ [Wait and listen] -> wait

=== examine_room ===
The room is small and dimly lit. There's a {~dusty|old|worn} book on the table.

* [Read the book] -> read_book
* [Ignore it and try the door] -> try_door
- -> start

=== try_door ===
{try_door > 1: You try the door again, but it's still} The door is locked tight.
-> start

=== wait ===
You hear footsteps approaching...
-> dramatic_entrance

=== dramatic_entrance ===
The door creaks open slowly.
-> END
```

## Working with Multiple Files

The extension supports Ink's INCLUDE functionality:

**main.ink:**
```ink
INCLUDE /characters.ink

=== start ===
You meet {random_character()}.
-> END
```

**characters.ink:**
```ink
VAR character_name = ""

=== function random_character ===
~ character_name = "{~Alice|Bob|Charlie}"
~ return character_name
```

## Commands

- **Ink: Compile File** - Manually compile the current Ink file
- **Ink: Debug Compile File** - Compile with detailed debug output

- **Keyboard shortcuts** - use number keys (1-9) for quick choice selection
- **Story restart** anytime with `Ctrl/Cmd+R` or the restart button
- **Side-by-side workflow** - code and preview in perfect harmony
- **Error handling** with clear feedback when compilation fails

*🚀 Future enhancement: External function stubbing with JavaScript for advanced testing scenarios*
