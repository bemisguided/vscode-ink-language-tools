- **Flow Control**: `divert`, `tunnel`, `gather`
- **Variables**: `var`, `const`, `temp`, `assign`
- **Logic**: `if`, `cond` (conditional text)
- **Alternation**: `seq` (sequence), `cycle`, `shuffle`, `once`
- **Lists**: `list`
- **Utility**: `comment`, `tag`, `include`, `end`, `done`

### üîß Language Configuration
- Smart bracket matching and auto-closing
- Proper comment toggling (`//` and `/* */`)
- Intelligent indentation for Ink structures
- Word boundary detection optimized for Ink syntax

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Create a new file with the `.ink` extension
3. Start writing your interactive story!
4. The extension will automatically compile your story and show any errors in the Problems panel

## Example Usage

```ink
=== start ===
You wake up in a mysterious room.

* [Look around] -> examine_room
* [Try the door] -> try_door
+ [Wait and listen] -> wait

=== examine_room ===
The room is small and dimly lit. There's a {~dusty|old|worn} book on the table.

* [Read the book] -> read_book
* [Ignore it and try the door] -> try_door
- -> start

=== try_door ===
{try_door > 1: You try the door again, but it's still} The door is locked tight.
-> start

=== wait ===
You hear footsteps approaching...
-> dramatic_entrance

=== dramatic_entrance ===
The door creaks open slowly.
-> END
```

## Working with Multiple Files

The extension supports Ink's INCLUDE functionality:

**main.ink:**
```ink
INCLUDE /characters.ink

=== start ===
You meet {random_character()}.
-> END
```

**characters.ink:**
```ink
VAR character_name = ""

=== function random_character ===
~ character_name = "{~Alice|Bob|Charlie}"
~ return character_name
```

## Commands

- **Ink: Compile File** - Manually compile the current Ink file
- **Ink: Debug Compile File** - Compile with detailed debug output
- **Ink: Open Story Preview** - Open an interactive preview panel to play your story

### üìñ Story Preview

The preview panel provides an immersive way to test your interactive stories:

- **Interactive playthrough** with clickable choices
- **Real-time updates** when you save changes to your Ink files  
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - use number keys (1-9) for quick choice selection
- **Story restart** anytime with `Ctrl/Cmd+R` or the restart button
- **Side-by-side workflow** - code and preview in perfect harmony
- **Error handling** with clear feedback when compilation fails
- **External function mocking** with JavaScript for advanced game integration testing

### üé≠ External Function Mocking

Test your Ink stories with external functions using JavaScript mocks:

1. **Create a mock file** (e.g., `game-mocks.js`) with your function implementations:
   ```javascript
   function get_player_name() {
     return "Alex";
   }
   
   function get_player_health() {
     return 100;
   }
   
   function heal_player(amount) {
     // Mock game logic here
     return true;
   }
   ```

2. **Reference the mock file** in your Ink story's first line. The path is relative to the Ink file:
   ```ink
   // MOCKS game-mocks.js
   // or
   // MOCKS ../mocks/game-mocks.js
   // or
   // MOCKS ./mocks/game-mocks.js
   
   EXTERNAL get_player_name()
   EXTERNAL get_player_health()
   EXTERNAL heal_player(amount)
   
   === start ===
   Hello {get_player_name()}! Your health is {get_player_health()}.
   ```

3. **See function calls in action** - the preview displays:
   - **Function calls in yellow** showing arguments and return values
   - **Real-time execution** as your story progresses
   - **Historical calls in grey** for previous story content

This enables rapid prototyping and testing of game-integrated interactive fiction!

## Future Enhancements
